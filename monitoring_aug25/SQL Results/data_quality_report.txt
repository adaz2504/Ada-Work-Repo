MONITORING SQL DATA QUALITY REPORT
============================================================

Analysis Date: 2025-08-13
Total Rows: 100
Total Columns: 59

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
--------------------
1. IS_SWAP_IN column has all zero values
   - This may indicate no swap-in accounts in current data subset
   - Consider if this column is needed for analysis

2. UTILIZATION has negative values (min: -0.013731)
   - Negative utilization may indicate data quality issues
   - Could be due to credits/payments exceeding balances
   - Recommend investigating source data

3. DQ30_RATE shows all zeros
   - May indicate no 30-day delinquencies in sample
   - Or calculation issue in DQ30 logic

4. Assumption columns have 4% null values
   - Indicates some records not matching assumption table
   - May need to review join conditions

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
1. Review IS_SWAP_IN filter - may need broader data sample
2. Investigate negative utilization calculation
3. Verify DQ30_RATE calculation logic
4. Check assumption table join conditions
5. Consider data validation rules for ratios

METRICS WITHIN EXPECTED RANGES:
-----------------------------------
✅ PBAD: 0.000000 to 0.027778 (0% to 2.78%)
✅ SEVERITY: 0.00 to 50.00 (reasonable charge-off amounts)
✅ CREDIT_LINE: Max 5,000.00 (typical credit limits)
✅ Most UTILIZATION: -1.37% to 31.16% (mostly reasonable)

DATA COMPLETENESS SUMMARY:
------------------------------
• Core metrics: Complete (no nulls)
• Dimensional splits: Complete
• Assumption data: 96% complete
• Overall data quality: Good with minor issues

This project is about enhance monitoring, we would like to create monitoring views. 

We currently already have a tableau dashboard, the source script of the dashboard is in original_sql_script.txt

We want to be able to monitor these things:

1. Granular Views: The following views will be split by these splitter:
- Statement Number: if statement number <=12 then ‘Y1’, if statement number is between 12 and 24, then ‘Y2’, else ‘Y3+’
- Pre Clip Line (PCL): 300, 500, 1000, 2000, … , 8000
- Risk Group 
- Util Group
- Eligibility 
- Rewards Type: rewards and non rewards
- APR Type: high or low
- UG and RG can be looked at by every 3 groups, i.e., 1-3, 4-6. 7-9 
Pbad  
Severity 
Util 
DQ 30 Rate
Marginal Utility / Utility (Marginal Utility is calculated by incremental outstanding/clip amount)
Credit Line 
NIAT divided by principal OS
GACO divided by principal OS

2. Only Aggregate Views
Cash Advance 
Penality
Pvol
Attrition
Revolve
Outstanding

Please generate an actionable plan for this project.

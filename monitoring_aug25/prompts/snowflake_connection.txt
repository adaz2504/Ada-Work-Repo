We are going to work with Snowflake in this project. Can you do a simple "select 1"
We are going to work with raw SQL files. Put them in a folder "sql/"
Add a test query in that folder to read the snowflake table EDW_DB.PUBLIC.TU_RAW_TRADELINE_TRADE 
Put the query in sql/test_file1.sql

Use python code in python/snowflake.py to run these queries
